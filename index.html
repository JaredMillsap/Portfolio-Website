    <p> Thanks for stopping by and checking out my Portfolio! I've always taking intrest in software development and decideded to pursue additional training enrolling in True Coders Advanced technical training program. My experience is with full-stack web development using the .Net framework and .core. </p>
    <p> The TrueCoders training program is a project and lecture-based training program that aims to fill the growing need for data science and software developers. Projects include multiple personal and group-oriented tasks that involve multiple programming languages over the course of the program. 
        During this program I recieved over 500 hours of intensive, project-based training in programming languages and other technical skills, such as C#, .NET Core, SQL, Git, ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        These skills were developed by building multiple C# and SQL projects. The C# and SQL Projects were tracked using Git and GitHub for source control.
        </p>
